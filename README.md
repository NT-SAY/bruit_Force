📖 Usage
Basic Hash Attack
bash
python bruteforcer.py --target 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99 --type hash --wordlist passwords.txt
Web Form Attack
bash
python bruteforcer.py --target https://example.com/login --type web --wordlist passwords.txt --username admin
With Proxies
bash
python bruteforcer.py --target https://example.com/login --type web --wordlist passwords.txt --proxies proxies.txt
⚙️ Configuration
Command Line Arguments
Argument	Description	Required
--target	Target hash or URL	Yes
--type	Attack type (hash, web, ssh)	Yes
--wordlist	Path to password wordlist	Yes
--username	Username for authentication	No
--proxies	Path to proxies file	No
Wordlist Format
Plain text file with one password per line:

text
password
123456
admin
qwerty
...
Proxies Format
Plain text file with one proxy per line (SOCKS/HTTP):

text
socks5://user:pass@host:port
http://user:pass@host:port
socks4://host:port
🧠 Intelligent Features
Time Estimation
Predicts attack duration based on wordlist size and hardware

Provides feasibility analysis before starting

Recommends optimization strategies

Adaptive Strategies
Detects protection mechanisms (Cloudflare, CAPTCHA, WAF)

Automatically adjusts request rates and patterns

Rotates proxies and user agents intelligently

Performance Optimization
Multi-process CPU acceleration

Vectorized hash computations

Batch processing for efficiency

📊 Performance Metrics
Operation	Speed	Hardware
MD5 Hashing	5M hashes/sec	CPU
MD5 Hashing	10B hashes/sec	GPU (Theoretical)
Web Requests	10-50 reqs/sec	With proxies
🔧 Advanced Configuration
Custom Rules
Modify the RuleEngine class to add custom password mutation rules:

python
# Add custom suffixes and prefixes
common_suffixes = ['123', '!', '@', '#', '2023']
common_prefixes = ['admin', 'root', 'super']
Strategy Tuning
Adjust adaptive strategies in AdaptiveStrategyManager:

python
strategies = {
    ProtectionLevel.NONE: {'delay': 0.01, 'concurrency': 100},
    ProtectionLevel.WEAK: {'delay': 0.1, 'concurrency': 50},
    # ... more levels
}
